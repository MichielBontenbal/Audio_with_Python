# Audio_with_Python
A library to learn about audio processing with Python. Use the notebooks in this repo to get an understanding of analysing audio and displaying audio. 

This repo is about understanding your audio signal. This notebook is about audio processing and digital signal processing. There is no AI in this repo, also nothing about music with python.

This repo is still work in progress. 

## Contents
This repo contains 8 notebooks:
1. Audio with Python basics
2. Audio with Python advanced
3. Visualising audio with librosa
4. Another way to create a mel spectrogram
5. Intro to fourier transform
6. Energy and sound pressure level
7. Analysing audio with numpy
8. Filter & denoise 

**Everything is tested with Python 3.12**

## To do
- better .wav samples
- make a notebook just for feature selection with librosa
- revise notebook 4
- more explanation of audio theory
- solve last errors
- Work on a live spectogram
- convert file format (*.wav, *.mp3, *.ogg) => basics
